Logical Assessment:

1.> Configure a CRON job to run 24x7.
	
	step 1: cd /var/spool/cron
	step 2: open "crontabs" file in any text editor.
	step 3: append "* * * * * /path/to/your-script.sh"
	step 4: save and quit.
Note: here * means any combination of time (day, hours, minutes, seconds).

2.> Best method to handel 404 errors
	
	1.) Customize a 404 page:
		Whenever the rquested resource is not available,
		redirect the client to a page giving info for the 
		changes made to site and some way to contact developer
		to communicate the unreachabitiy of site. 

	2.) Check for the broken links on website:
		Use tools such as W3C Link checker to check all the resources,
		identify the broken links and trouble shoot the API, code or web server.

	3.) Use Appropriate HTTP status codes:
		The resource requested may be ureachable for technical issues, But if the
		resource is removed intentionally, it could still be indexed. use proper 
		HTTP status codes such as 204, 301, 410 to prevent it from getting indexed.

3.> MySQL dump gives syntax error on a new Linux server.

	1.) Check for the version of MySQL the server is using. And try to Install specefic version
	the syntax used.
	2.) Set the character encoding correctly. if the dump file has non-ASCII chars,
	set encoding using "SET NAMES 'utf8' or SET NAMES 'ascii';"
	3.) Use SQL syntax checker such as "Ever SQL".

4.> Recover data when your server chrashes:
	
	1.) Method 1 ( recover data from Saturday ):
		Copy the Databasefile ending with ".db" from your old system
		from "/var/lib/mysql/" and then paste it inside the new 
		system inside same /var/lib/mysql/name-of-your-database.db.
	2.) Method 2 ( recover data from Friday from the backup)
		Load the dump using the following command
		mysql -u username -p database_name < backup_file.sql.

5.> Best practices for images on a website.

	1.) Choose the right fie format for the pupose accordingly:
		Each image format has different compression techniqes associated with it
		suited for different purpose. 
		JPEG => instagram photos and such.
		PNG => best for logos, digital art.
		TIFF => High resolution lossless, for very detailed photos, 360 degree city view and such
	2.) Label images accurately:
		 forexample. 
		<figure>
			<img src="tiquet.png" height="150" width="90">
			<figcaption>Your label goes here</figcaption>
		</figure>
		And add "alt=" attribute to the image tag. for example
		<img src="tiquet.png" height="150" width="90" alt="Description of image goes here">
		It hels in SEO as well as Accessablity.
	3.) Choose method to store your images.
		You can store images as BLOBS in order to fit inside the DB directly. 
		This is useful when you do not have to move your database frequently and
		it releived you from headache to manage your resources (imgs) saparately 
		from DB. This can be slow in processing. 
		
		You can store your images as files somewhere separate from DB and use file paths to
		refer it. this is faster, usually keeps the DB size small enough, But management of 
		files could be difficult. 

6.> How to implement effective caching
	
	1.) separate all Static and Dynamic content into the separate directories in your project
	folder.
	2.) USE a CDN Content delivery network to serve static pages instantaneously.
	3.) We can set Cache header to tell the client browser to cache the content.
		inside the HTTP response:
		set the Cache_control header like this in order to cache pages for one day
		Cache-Control: max-age=86400
		here 86400 seconds represent one day.
